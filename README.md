This project is a Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase Firestore. It allows multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document from different devices, with instant synchronization of changes. Firebase Firestore serves as the backend, handling real-time data updates without the need for a separate server. The interface is simple, responsive, and user-friendly. This task demonstrates core skills in frontend development and cloud integration. It is part of Codtech's internship Task-3 requirement and showcases the use of modern web technologies to implement real-time collaboration efficiently in a browser environment
